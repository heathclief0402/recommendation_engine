Description
In this programming assignment we will build a movie recommendation engine. You are provided a ﬁle, critics.csv. It is a small dataset but good enough for this exercise. The ﬁle contains critics (individuals) and their ratings for diﬀerent movies. It is a comma separated ﬁle. Each line in the ﬁle represents the ratings of a critic (individual) and can be described as follows: ﬁrst ﬁeld is the critic’s name, followed by the movie name and its rating. Since the number of movies that each individual has seen may vary, so not all lines contain the same number of ﬁelds and the order of the ratings may vary as well.
We want to create a system such that we can recommend movies to each of these individuals based on their preferences and the similarities with other users in the dataset. A higher rating for a movie means the individual has preferred that genre of the movies. So someone else who also rates such movies higher would be more similar to the ﬁrst individual. Something akin to what Netﬂix would do, albeit on a very tiny dataset.
You are provided a starter Jupyter notebook with some pre-ﬁlled code and comments. You are supposed to ﬁll the code in the appropriate locations. This ﬁle also contains cells that should print the output of various functions in the notebook
